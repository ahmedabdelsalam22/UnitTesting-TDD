## Test-Driven Development with Flutter

Find out how to build a Flutter App with a Test-Driven Development approach. Get used to TDD with the Red-Green-Refactor rhythm, and never be afraid to make changes to your code.

TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
TDD is the process of creating software by writing tests in advance to prove the implementation fulfills the requirements. For most developers, it’s not something that comes naturally and the hardest part is to get used to it. But the good news is that the process of TDD is rhythmic, and because of that, I will try to show you by example how easy it is when you feel the rhythm. Basically, through all your work you need to repeat 3 steps/colors:

- Write a failing test (Red phase)

- Make the test pass — Write just enough code to pass the test (Green phase)

- Improve the code — Clean up the mess (Refactoring phase)
